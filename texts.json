  "about_us": "San Francisco Tango Exchange (SFTX) was an annual tango event that ran from 2006 - 2009. SFTX concentrates on using guided exercises and technical games as a platform to a weekend of tango adventures. We aim to create a safe environment for every dance to 'explore, discover, and exchange'. We're working to reboot it.",
